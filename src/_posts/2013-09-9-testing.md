>Something that is always appropriate, regardless of general style, is when you get a bug report. ALWAYS create a test case first & run your tests. Make sure it demonstrates the failure, THEN go fix the bug. If your fix is correct, that new test should pass! It's an excellent way to sanity check yourself & is a great way to get started with testing to boot.
