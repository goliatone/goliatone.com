So, everybody wants to be cool. Right? Nowadays cool kids either grow a french mustache, wear thick framed glasses, or code in Ruby. I decided to go with option number 3 and learn Ruby.

I had exposure to the language, mainly through [Project Sprouts](http://projectsprouts.org/) and [Flexible Rails](http://www.manning.com/armstrong/) wich I read back in 2008. But I wanted to really dig in and since the best way to learn is to practice, I decided I would start a small project using Ruby. 

After a small search, I decided to give a try to the following combo:
    Rails + Toto + Heroku + Git 

I have to admit that I am loving it.
