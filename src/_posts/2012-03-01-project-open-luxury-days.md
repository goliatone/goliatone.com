After a short but intense development cycle, here it is: [www.openluxurydays.com](http://www.openluxurydays.com)

For this project I used the Kohana libraries I've released as open source on [github](https://github.com/goliatone). Every project is a good chance to keep them sharp and find/squish bugs.

More soon...
