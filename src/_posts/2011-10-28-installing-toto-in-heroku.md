Deploying toto in Heroku has been a breeze. I decided to go with toto for it's simplicity. In terms of code is really manageable, I think the main class might have around 350 lines of code- it is build on top of Rack with takes does much of the work.
All in all makes it a really nice blog engine and stays out of the way most of the time.
