### Karma: Aborted due warnings unhelpful error

I really enjoy testing with karma. However, there is something that drives me nuts about it: 

```terminal
...

Could there be anything more fucking unhelpful?

It took me a while to figure out what was going on. In my case, I was bitted in the ass by the fact that PhantomJS does not implement `.bind`. Ol√®! You can read [things][1]....

Anyhow, quick fix: add a shim to your test entry point file. Something like this would work:

```javascript
'use strict';
/**
 * PhantomJS does not have a `bind` method :(
 * polyfill'it!
 */
Function.prototype.bind=Function.prototype.bind||function(b){if(typeof this!=="function"){throw new TypeError("Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable");}var a=Array.prototype.slice,f=a.call(arguments,1),e=this,c=function(){},d=function(){return e.apply(this instanceof c?this:b||window,f.concat(a.call(arguments)));};c.prototype=this.prototype;d.prototype=new c();return d;};
```
