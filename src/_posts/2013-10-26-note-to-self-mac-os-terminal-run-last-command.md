## Note to self

### Run last command
Simple shortcut that stands in place of your previously written command:

```terminal
!!
```
Yup, that's it. This is useful after having typed a long command, we find out it needed root privileges.
To enter the last command again but with sudo in front, we can just type:

```terminal
sudo !!
```
