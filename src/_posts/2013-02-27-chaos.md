life is a mess, emotions, chaos, entropy. A flow of accumulative stream of random emotions. Disconnected and unitary.
But also, full of potential, endless combinations, infinite ways of threading reality.

cosmological view of emotions. Emotions as organic entities, that move, and interact with each other.
we try to make sense out of chaos. move into detail and thread a narrative. **its interesting to see how size is inverted, the pixels/emotions represent the universe, which has a bigger mass...then full blown pages represent ideas, which are tiny (?)

-we start with a god-like view, we can see 'humanity' dreaming...

- We might want to make ideas/dreams organic, and have the threading be natural association between different entities. We can use properties to define how they will interact. There is color, intensity, we can associate a positive/negative vibe to it...elements would assimilate each other making a bigger organism, a narrative :)
