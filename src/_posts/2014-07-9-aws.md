## Amazon Web Services

Amazon's JavaScript SDK ships with default support for DynamoDB, S3, SNS, SQS, Kinesis, CloudWatch, and STS.

### Amazon Kinesis
One common use of Amazon Kinesis is real-time aggregation of data to be then consumed into a data warehouse or a map-reduce (Amazon Elastic MapReduce EMR) cluster. 
Amazon Kinesis applications- usually run on ECS- can start consuming the data form the stream less than 10 seconds after the data is added. 
Many applications can consume data from a stream concurrently and independently- say to perform actions like archiving and processing.

Data records are accessible for only 24 hours from the time they are added.


### S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- S3 require explicit configuration for CORS. Other services only require that the request is signed using auth keys that have permissions on the resource.
