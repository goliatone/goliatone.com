### [How to avoid callback hell?][]

>Try streamline.js. It is not a library but a language tool. Problem is solved and people should start to use real solutions instead of whining and re-inventing the wheel.

Then, he goes again:

>Opposite experience with streamline. We use the tool everyday and we'll never go back to callbacks. It probably has to do with the fact that libraries only solve a small part of the problem while a language tool can do a lot more: restore chaining, composition, operators, this, exception handling, etc. It lets you write things like:
If (f1(_).p1 < f2(_).p2) return f3(_).f4();
Libraries don't help much with that kind of simple logic.

So, on google search later- about [Fibers][] in node-, already forgotten of the dude, i run into this [Sponsored Ad][], at least this time he singals it.
